# csvolunteering
Express App used to build a basic example of a CS Volunteering web application 

## Getting started
To run locally run git pull on the repo url, access the command line, enter npm start and then navigate to localhost:3000

## Demo
If your interested, I've also got a hosted instance of the app on heroku: https://csvolunteering.herokuapp.com/
